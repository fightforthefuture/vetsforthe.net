        Veterans support net neutrality
      </h1>
      <p>Veterans, military families, and service members rely on the Internet to keep in touch with loved 
      ones overseas and access essential services at home. The open Internet allows American small businesses 
      to thrive, and has created new jobs &mdash; in the tech field and others &mdash; that veterans urgently need.
      The loss of net neutrality will allow cable companies to throttle services to online communities used by 
      service members, censor free speech, and charge new fees that veterans can’t afford.

      The Senate has already moved to restore Net Neutrality protection.  Now we need the House of Representatives
      to do the same.  If you are a fellow Veteran, we urge you to sign this open letter to Congress demanding a
      return to net neutrality.

        How to Organize a Letter Delivery

      <ol>
        <li>
          <h4>Pick a Congressional Office and Add It to the Map</h4>
          <p>First, decide which member of Congress’ office you want to deliver the letter to. <a href="https://www.battleforthenet.com/scoreboard/" target="_blank">Check here</a> to see where your lawmakers stand on the CRA to save net neutrality and, if you can, organize the letter delivery at the office of a lawmaker who does not yet support the CRA. Preserving the open Internet matters to the overwhelming majority of Americans, so it’s important that we persuade as many members of Congress as possible to vote for the CRA.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Recruit Others and Alert Local Media</h4>
          <p>Once you add your event to the map, we’ll contact other veterans and net neutrality supporters in your area and encourage them to attend. But you should spread the word too! Invite others to join you directly via email, text message, and social media <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dS-GtwKUxFPnjcpXzTtEroEiGmct1L6B-aUVBewN1YQ/" target="_blank">(sample content here)</a>. Send a simple Media Advisory <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dS-GtwKUxFPnjcpXzTtEroEiGmct1L6B-aUVBewN1YQ/" target="_blank">(sample here)</a> to local reporters and invite them to come.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4 id="deliver-the-letter">Deliver the Letter</h4>
          <p>Select your state below to print out the letter and complete list of veterans who have signed on. Show up a few minutes early and wait outside the office for others to come. Around 15 minutes after the start time, go into the office with your crew of people and deliver the letter to the staffer at the front desk. Be friendly and polite, note the number of businesses in their district that have signed, and ask them to make sure the lawmaker gets it. Reiterate the ask of the letter: we want the Congress member to support the Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution to overturn the FCC’s repeal of net neutrality.</p>
          <div class="state-selector flex-row">
            <select v-model="selectedState">
              <option :value="null">Select your state</option>
              <option v-for="(name, abbr) in states" :key="abbr" :value="abbr">{{ name }}</option>

          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Talk to the Press</h4>
          <p>After you deliver the letter, host a short “press conference” outside the office. Gather all your supporters together in a tight group right in front of the building. Think about how it will look in a photo in the local paper. Face the press with your crowd behind you. Every veteran in attendance is encouraged to speak about why they signed the letter and why net neutrality is important to them <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dS-GtwKUxFPnjcpXzTtEroEiGmct1L6B-aUVBewN1YQ/edit" target="_blank">(sample talking points here)</a>, but we encourage each veteran to limit their speaking time to 2 minutes so everyone has a chance to be heard. Have copies of the letter and/or your press advisory to hand to reporters. The whole thing should be quick; you can wrap it up after 30 minutes or so! Be sure to post photos on social media using the hashtags #VetsForTheNet and #NetNeutrality, and send them to us at <a href="mailto:team@fightforthefuture.org">team@fightforthefuture.org</a> so we can share them with the world on social media!</p>
